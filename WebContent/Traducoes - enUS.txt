However, texts which were modified here will be applied to all the libraries in the group, provided they have not modified the original value of each translation.</p>
<p>For example, if you modify the translation of the key <strong>"menu.search"</strong> from "Search" to "Trace" through the Translations module for multi-libraries, all the libraries in this group will see the new translation. However, if one of the administrators of one of these libraries modifies, through the <strong>"Translations"</strong> module of his library, the same key to "Search", this in-house translation will have priority just for this library.</p>
<p>In order to add a new language, you will have to download the language file in Portuguese, do the translation of the texts and then upload the file. Remember that only the <strong>texts</strong> (after the = sign) must be modified.  Do not modify the keys, as otherwise the Biblivre 4 will not be able to trace the text </p>
<p>Example: Let´s say that you wish to modify the text in the main menu from <i>Search</i> to <i>Trace</i>.  You will have to download the language file and modify this line:</p>
<p><strong>*menu.search</strong> = Search</p>
<p>To:</p>
<p><strong>*menu.search</strong> = Trace</p>
